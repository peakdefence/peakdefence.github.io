&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through more security audits than I can count. Both, conducting them and being on the receiving end. I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on the auditor&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, watching teams scramble to provide evidence for controls they claim to have. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the auditee side too, working late nights to gather documentation, chasing system owners, and frantically updating tracking spreadsheets.I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a ton of security audits, both as the one doing the auditing and the one being audited. When I&amp;rsquo;m the auditor, I often see teams scramble to prove they actually have the security controls they say they do. And when I&amp;rsquo;m the one being audited, I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled plenty of all-nighters gathering documentation, chasing down system owners, and frantically trying to keep those tracking spreadsheets up to date.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backend / Full-Stack Developer</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/careers/backend-developer/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Feb 2025 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/careers/backend-developer/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="mission-connection">Mission Connection&lt;/h2>

Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Virtual CISO services provided by Peak Defence (&amp;ldquo;Services&amp;rdquo;). It explains how we handle data in the course of providing these Services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="2-data-processing-and-personal-data">2. Data Processing and Personal Data&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Services are designed not to process personal data. There is no expectation or requirement for users to upload personal data into the product and this would contradict the Terms of service.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="3-data-hosting-and-processing">3. Data Hosting and Processing&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The Services are hosted on AWS infrastructure located within the European Union (EU) - or in other regions if specifically contracted with customers. AWS acts as a data processor on behalf of Peak Defence.
Langfuse is another data processor used for the hosted service (for deployments under Starter package, starting from Scaleup and Enterprise packages a different deployment model can be negotiated), under strict data protection agreements - they receive the queries data made against the service and responses to the queries, but not the original data / documents used to create answers.
Users have the option to run a local version of the Services on AWS, or for Enterprise versions, a hosted version where no data leaves the customer&amp;rsquo;s premises.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schedule a Demo</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/demo/</guid><description>&lt;div class="meetings-iframe-container" data-src="https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/roman-jasins?embed=true">&lt;/div>
