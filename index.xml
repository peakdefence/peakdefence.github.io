&lt;p>Planning can be super helpful or just annoying overhead – it all depends on whether you hit the right balance. This is true for pretty much everything, not just security. Finding this balance is key to getting the right velocity – not about being fast or slow in absolute terms, but moving forward steadily without rushing and creating more problems than you solve.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s intricate risk environment, a risk owner&amp;rsquo;s role is essential for maintaining an organization&amp;rsquo;s security and compliance. Risk owners act as the main custodians of designated risks, overseeing their continuous assessment, management, and mitigation. Among their most vital duties is performing comprehensive and efficient risk reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide is designed to equip risk owners with a clear framework for conducting risk reviews, helping them effectively meet their responsibilities and enhance the organization&amp;rsquo;s overarching risk management strategy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting the Dots: Why Security Knowledge Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:12:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/connecting-the-dots.png" alt="image Impact of Security Knowledge Fragmentation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a troubling pattern that we have seen in enterprises of all sizes: &lt;strong>fragmented security knowledge&lt;/strong>. And in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-evolving landscape, this fragmentation is more &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; than ever. Just like the parable of the blind men and the elephant—where each man touches a different part and describes a completely different animal - teams often work with partial views of their security posture, leading to serious blind spots and ineffective decision-making.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Sourcing the Peak Defence Method: Transforming Security Management</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/open-source-methodology/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/open-source-methodology/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/enhancing_security_rhrough_knowledge_sharing.png" alt="Enhancing Security Through Knowledge Sharing">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite record spending on tools and technologies, many organizations still struggle to build effective security management programs. The troubling reality is that the gap between security investment and actual outcomes continues to widen—and for good reason.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Security approaches often fail not because of poor implementation, but because they&amp;rsquo;re built on flawed assumptions about the nature of security itself. The Peak Defence Method is founded on a different perspective — one that acknowledges the inherent complexity and unpredictability of modern systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This chapter explains the philosophical foundation and core principles that guide our approach across organizations of all sizes and maturity levels. These principles inform every aspect of the methodology, from how we &lt;a href="shaping.md">shape work&lt;/a> to how we implement security controls and measure security effectiveness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Link in Security Management: Why Cross-Functional Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/cross-functional-security-integration.png" alt="image Operating Security in Silos Actively Undermines Its Effectiveness">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-invisible-walls">The Invisible Walls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After years of working with information security, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently observed one troubling pattern: security teams operating as islands. This isolation isn&amp;rsquo;t just unfortunate — it&amp;rsquo;s actively undermining security effectiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symptoms are easy to spot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Security requirements arrive too late (sometimes never) in development processes, creating friction and delays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Business units view security as a blocker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security teams struggle to articulate value in terms that resonate with the rest of the organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security incidents reveal fundamental disconnects between security controls and operational realities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compliance activities become burdensome rubber-stamping motions disconnected from actual risks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These aren&amp;rsquo;t isolated problems. They&amp;rsquo;re symptoms of a systemic issue: &lt;strong>the difficulty to integrate security across organizational functions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Planning Horizons</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/planning/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/planning/</guid><description>&lt;!-- # Planning Horizons -->
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective security requires working across multiple time horizons simultaneously. Without a structured approach to planning, organizations typically face these common challenges:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Strategic initiatives get interrupted by tactical and urgent needs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Long-term architectural decisions lack follow-through&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Short-term work doesn&amp;rsquo;t align with strategic direction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Teams lose context when switching between immediate and long-term work&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security priorities constantly shift, creating waste and confusion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-functional dependencies create bottlenecks and misalignment&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security requirements are introduced too late in product or business processes&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Four Horizons Framework provides a structured way to organize security initiatives across different timescales, ensuring that both strategic long-term objectives and tactical immediate needs receive appropriate attention. It also creates natural connection points with other organizational functions, enabling more effective cross-functional security work. This chapter explains how organizations of all sizes can implement this framework at their appropriate maturity level.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shaping Security Work</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/shaping/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/shaping/</guid><description>&lt;!-- # Shaping Security Work -->
&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Security initiatives fail for many reasons, but often there is a common pattern: &lt;strong>they&amp;rsquo;re either too vague or too specific before implementation begins&lt;/strong>. Traditional approaches oscillate between these extremes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Too abstract&lt;/strong>: &amp;ldquo;Implement zero trust architecture&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Improve our security posture&amp;rdquo; lack clear boundaries and direction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Too concrete&lt;/strong>: Detailed specifications that over-constrain implementation teams and can&amp;rsquo;t adapt to discoveries made during implementation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Shaping security work is the critical process that bridges this gap. It creates &lt;strong>just enough structure&lt;/strong> to enable teams to deliver meaningful security improvements within fixed time constraints, while leaving room for adaptation and expertise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security Roles and Responsibilities</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/roles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/resources/method/roles/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Effective security outcomes depend not just on what we do, but on &lt;strong>who does it&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>how responsibilities are distributed&lt;/strong>. Many security initiatives fail despite solid technical foundations because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Security responsibilities are unclear or undefined&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The wrong people make security decisions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Crucial stakeholders aren&amp;rsquo;t involved at the right time&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-functional dependencies aren&amp;rsquo;t managed effectively&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security requirements aren&amp;rsquo;t translated for different audiences&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security responsibilities don&amp;rsquo;t scale with organizational growth&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through more security audits than I can count. Both, conducting them and being on the receiving end. I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on the auditor&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, watching teams scramble to provide evidence for controls they claim to have. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the auditee side too, working late nights to gather documentation, chasing system owners, and frantically updating tracking spreadsheets.I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a ton of security audits, both as the one doing the auditing and the one being audited. When I&amp;rsquo;m the auditor, I often see teams scramble to prove they actually have the security controls they say they do. And when I&amp;rsquo;m the one being audited, I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled plenty of all-nighters gathering documentation, chasing down system owners, and frantically trying to keep those tracking spreadsheets up to date.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/privacy-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/privacy-policy/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="1-introduction">1.

&lt;p>The Peak Defence Methodology represents a fundamental shift in how organizations approach information security. Rather than treating security as a series of technical controls or compliance checkboxes, our methodology centers on the perfect integration of &lt;strong>People&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Process&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Technology&lt;/strong> to create resilient, proactive security programs that deliver measurable outcomes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our approach is born from years of experience witnessing the same patterns across organizations of all sizes: manual processes creating bottlenecks, reactive approaches leaving vulnerabilities unaddressed, and disconnected systems preventing comprehensive visibility. The Peak Defence Methodology, powered by our Wingman AI platform, breaks this cycle.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Schedule a Demo</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/demo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/demo/</guid><description>&lt;div class="meetings-iframe-container" data-src="https://meetings-eu1.hubspot.com/roman-jasins?embed=true">&lt;/div>
