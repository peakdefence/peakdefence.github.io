&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced security landscape, creating innovative governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions requires more than just technical expertise. At Peak Defence, our Wingman AI-powered GRC platform has transformed how organizations manage security, but the story of &lt;em>how&lt;/em> we build and ship Wingman is just as important as what we&amp;rsquo;ve built.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shaping-ideas-not-just-features">Shaping Ideas, Not Just Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our approach to building Wingman begins long before any code is written. We&amp;rsquo;ve adopted a deliberate process of shaping work that ensures we&amp;rsquo;re solving real problems with meaningful solutions.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
