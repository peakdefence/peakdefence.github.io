&lt;p>Despite record spending on tools and technologies, many organizations still struggle to build effective security management programs. The troubling reality is that the gap between security investment and actual outcomes continues to widen—and for good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Security isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technology. It never has been.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Link in Security Management: Why Cross-Functional Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/cross-functional-security-integration.png" alt="image Operating Security in Silos Actively Undermines Its Effectiveness">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-invisible-walls">The Invisible Walls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After years of working with information security, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently observed one troubling pattern: security teams operating as islands. This isolation isn&amp;rsquo;t just unfortunate — it&amp;rsquo;s actively undermining security effectiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symptoms are easy to spot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Security requirements arrive too late (sometimes never) in development processes, creating friction and delays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Business units view security as a blocker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security teams struggle to articulate value in terms that resonate with the rest of the organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security incidents reveal fundamental disconnects between security controls and operational realities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compliance activities become burdensome rubber-stamping motions disconnected from actual risks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These aren&amp;rsquo;t isolated problems. They&amp;rsquo;re symptoms of a systemic issue: &lt;strong>the difficulty to integrate security across organizational functions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
