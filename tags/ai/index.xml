&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through more security audits than I can count. Both, conducting them and being on the receiving end. I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on the auditor&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, watching teams scramble to provide evidence for controls they claim to have. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the auditee side too, working late nights to gather documentation, chasing system owners, and frantically updating tracking spreadsheets.I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a ton of security audits, both as the one doing the auditing and the one being audited. When I&amp;rsquo;m the auditor, I often see teams scramble to prove they actually have the security controls they say they do. And when I&amp;rsquo;m the one being audited, I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled plenty of all-nighters gathering documentation, chasing down system owners, and frantically trying to keep those tracking spreadsheets up to date.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
