&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s intricate risk environment, a risk owner&amp;rsquo;s role is essential for maintaining an organization&amp;rsquo;s security and compliance. Risk owners act as the main custodians of designated risks, overseeing their continuous assessment, management, and mitigation. Among their most vital duties is performing comprehensive and efficient risk reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide is designed to equip risk owners with a clear framework for conducting risk reviews, helping them effectively meet their responsibilities and enhance the organization&amp;rsquo;s overarching risk management strategy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting the Dots: Why Security Knowledge Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:12:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/connecting-the-dots.png" alt="image Impact of Security Knowledge Fragmentation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a troubling pattern that we have seen in enterprises of all sizes: &lt;strong>fragmented security knowledge&lt;/strong>. And in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-evolving landscape, this fragmentation is more &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; than ever. Just like the parable of the blind men and the elephant—where each man touches a different part and describes a completely different animal - teams often work with partial views of their security posture, leading to serious blind spots and ineffective decision-making.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Link in Security Management: Why Cross-Functional Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/cross-functional-security-integration.png" alt="image Operating Security in Silos Actively Undermines Its Effectiveness">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-invisible-walls">The Invisible Walls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After years of working with information security, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently observed one troubling pattern: security teams operating as islands. This isolation isn&amp;rsquo;t just unfortunate — it&amp;rsquo;s actively undermining security effectiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symptoms are easy to spot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Security requirements arrive too late (sometimes never) in development processes, creating friction and delays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Business units view security as a blocker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security teams struggle to articulate value in terms that resonate with the rest of the organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security incidents reveal fundamental disconnects between security controls and operational realities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compliance activities become burdensome rubber-stamping motions disconnected from actual risks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These aren&amp;rsquo;t isolated problems. They&amp;rsquo;re symptoms of a systemic issue: &lt;strong>the difficulty to integrate security across organizational functions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
