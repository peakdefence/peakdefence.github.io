&lt;p>Despite record spending on tools and technologies, many organizations still struggle to build effective security management programs. The troubling reality is that the gap between security investment and actual outcomes continues to widen—and for good reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Security isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technology. It never has been.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most security failures don&amp;rsquo;t stem from a lack of tools; they come from fundamental disconnects in how security is managed:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Risk Owner's Guide to Effective Risk Reviews</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/the-risk-owners-guide-to-effective-risk-reviews/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Mar 2025 08:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/the-risk-owners-guide-to-effective-risk-reviews/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="understanding-the-critical-role-of-a-risk-owner">Understanding the Critical Role of a Risk Owner&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s intricate risk environment, a risk owner&amp;rsquo;s role is essential for maintaining an organization&amp;rsquo;s security and compliance. Risk owners act as the main custodians of designated risks, overseeing their continuous assessment, management, and mitigation. Among their most vital duties is performing comprehensive and efficient risk reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide is designed to equip risk owners with a clear framework for conducting risk reviews, helping them effectively meet their responsibilities and enhance the organization&amp;rsquo;s overarching risk management strategy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting the Dots: Why Security Knowledge Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 04:12:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/connecting-the-dots/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/connecting-the-dots.png" alt="image Impact of Security Knowledge Fragmentation">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="connecting-the-dots">Connecting the Dots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There is a troubling pattern that we have seen in enterprises of all sizes: &lt;strong>fragmented security knowledge&lt;/strong>. And in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-evolving landscape, this fragmentation is more &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; than ever. Just like the parable of the blind men and the elephant—where each man touches a different part and describes a completely different animal - teams often work with partial views of their security posture, leading to serious blind spots and ineffective decision-making.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Missing Link in Security Management: Why Cross-Functional Integration Matters</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/cross-functional-security-integration/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/cross-functional-security-integration.png" alt="image Operating Security in Silos Actively Undermines Its Effectiveness">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-invisible-walls">The Invisible Walls&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After years of working with information security, I&amp;rsquo;ve consistently observed one troubling pattern: security teams operating as islands. This isolation isn&amp;rsquo;t just unfortunate — it&amp;rsquo;s actively undermining security effectiveness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The symptoms are easy to spot:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Security requirements arrive too late (sometimes never) in development processes, creating friction and delays.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Business units view security as a blocker.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security teams struggle to articulate value in terms that resonate with the rest of the organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Security incidents reveal fundamental disconnects between security controls and operational realities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compliance activities become burdensome rubber-stamping motions disconnected from actual risks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These aren&amp;rsquo;t isolated problems. They&amp;rsquo;re symptoms of a systemic issue: &lt;strong>the difficulty to integrate security across organizational functions&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What AI Means for Your Security Team</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/what-ai-means-for-your-security-team/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:14:54 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/what-ai-means-for-your-security-team/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-journey-from-spreadsheet-to-ai-powered-security">My Journey From Spreadsheet to AI-Powered Security&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through more security audits than I can count. Both, conducting them and being on the receiving end. I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on the auditor&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, watching teams scramble to provide evidence for controls they claim to have. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the auditee side too, working late nights to gather documentation, chasing system owners, and frantically updating tracking spreadsheets.I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a ton of security audits, both as the one doing the auditing and the one being audited. When I&amp;rsquo;m the auditor, I often see teams scramble to prove they actually have the security controls they say they do. And when I&amp;rsquo;m the one being audited, I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled plenty of all-nighters gathering documentation, chasing down system owners, and frantically trying to keep those tracking spreadsheets up to date.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
