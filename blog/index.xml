&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://peakdefence.com/images/blog/connecting-the-dots.png" alt="image Impact of Security Knowledge Fragmentation">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a troubling pattern that we have seen in enterprises of all sizes: &lt;strong>fragmented security knowledge&lt;/strong>. And in today&amp;rsquo;s fast-evolving landscape, this fragmentation is more &amp;ldquo;dangerous&amp;rdquo; than ever. Just like the parable of the blind men and the elephantâ€”where each man touches a different part and describes a completely different animal - teams often work with partial views of their security posture, leading to serious blind spots and ineffective decision-making.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Sourcing Security Management</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/open-source-methodology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:00:00 -0651</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/open-source-methodology/</guid><description>&lt;!-- ## Why We're Open Sourcing Our Security Management Methodology -->
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve been observing something troubling for a while now: despite increasing investments in security tools and technologies, many organizations still struggle to build effective security programs. The gap between spending and outcomes continues to widen, and we think there&amp;rsquo;s a fundamental reason why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security isn&amp;rsquo;t just about technology. It never has been.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Peak Defence, we&amp;rsquo;ve spent years learning, iterating and developing methodology that balances People, Process, and Technology. Our approach incorporates four planning horizons that ensure both strategic vision and practical execution:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shipping Wingman</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/wingman-build-ship-iterate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:14:54 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/wingman-build-ship-iterate/</guid><description>&lt;!-- # Building and Shipping Wingman: Our Balanced Approach to GRC Innovation -->
&lt;p>In today&amp;rsquo;s fast-paced security landscape, creating innovative governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions requires more than just technical expertise. At Peak Defence, our Wingman AI-powered GRC platform has transformed how organizations manage security, but the story of &lt;em>how&lt;/em> we build and ship Wingman is just as important as what we&amp;rsquo;ve built.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shaping-ideas-not-just-features">Shaping Ideas, Not Just Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our approach to building Wingman begins long before any code is written. We&amp;rsquo;ve adopted a deliberate process of shaping work that ensures we&amp;rsquo;re solving real problems with meaningful solutions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What AI Means for Your Security Team</title><link>https://peakdefence.com/blog/what-ai-means-for-your-security-team/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2025 04:14:54 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://peakdefence.com/blog/what-ai-means-for-your-security-team/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="my-journey-from-spreadsheet-to-ai-powered-security">My Journey From Spreadsheet to AI-Powered Security&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been through more security audits than I can count. Both, conducting them and being on the receiving end. I&amp;rsquo;ve sat on the auditor&amp;rsquo;s side of the table, watching teams scramble to provide evidence for controls they claim to have. I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the auditee side too, working late nights to gather documentation, chasing system owners, and frantically updating tracking spreadsheets.I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved in a ton of security audits, both as the one doing the auditing and the one being audited. When I&amp;rsquo;m the auditor, I often see teams scramble to prove they actually have the security controls they say they do. And when I&amp;rsquo;m the one being audited, I&amp;rsquo;ve pulled plenty of all-nighters gathering documentation, chasing down system owners, and frantically trying to keep those tracking spreadsheets up to date.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
